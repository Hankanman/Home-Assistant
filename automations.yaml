# This file is used by the automations editor
# in the Home Assistant frontend.
#
# I personally do not use it, mainly because I like doing this in YAML.
# However, from time to time, it is helpful to click a bit and see
# what the frontend makes of it.
#
# This file must exist for the frontend Automation editor to work.
# Hence, it is here, empty. 
#
# If you are looking for my automations: See automations folder.
