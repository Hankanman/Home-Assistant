# Smart Home with Home Assistant

The ultimate goal, as with any smart home is to have something like J.A.R.V.I.S running your home, so you can focus on builidng the Iron Man suit, naturally. In lieu of a super intelligent near sentient AI, get as close as possible :)

  It all starts and ends with Home Assistant, free, open-source home automation, this is the glue that holds it all together!

Man I love Unraid, it's a VM host, Docker host and manager, and first and foremost a NAS that doesn't need raid to keep your data safe!
