# Smart Home with Home Assistant

## The Objective

The ultimate goal, as with any smart home is to have something like J.A.R.V.I.S running your home, so you can focus on builidng the Iron Man suit, naturally. In lieu of a super intelligent near sentient AI, get as close as possible :)

## Tools of Choice

### Software/Services

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
  
  It all starts and ends with Home Assistant, free, open-source home automation, this is the glue that holds it all together!

  **Home Assistant Add-Ons (Docker Containers)**

  - [Room Assistant](https://www.room-assistant.io/)

    Uses Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, Thermal Sensors, Motion and any other input to track room presence, this is key to getting accurate automations.

- [Unraid](https://unraid.net/)
  
  Man I love Unraid, it's a VM host, Docker host and manager, and first and foremost a NAS that doesn't need raid to keep your data safe!
